## Analytics
This project utilizes Mixpanel third-party analytics to track data and trends over time. 

I track most important events on the website. I receive a weekly email digest with site analytics. Helps me stay up to date on the site is being used, what flows users commonly engage with, and what can improved, added, or modified from the site.
