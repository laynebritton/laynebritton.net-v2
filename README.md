## Analytics
This project utilizes Mixpanel third-party analytics to track data and trends over time. 

I track most important events on the website. I receive a weekly email digest with site analytics. Helps me stay up to date on the site is being used, what flows users commonly engage with, and what can improved, added, or modified from the site.

For some visuals, here's a snapshot of my analytics dashboard from the month of August in 2022

### FAQ

- Why is the build folder included in the versioning?

Normally I would not do this, it's just to save money. I am hosting this project on the cheapest tier of Google Cloud. Running an npm build on that host takes upwards of an hour and often freezes up. There is no private or trade-secret information in this site, it is all information I want published publicly anyway. If the situation were any different, I would upgrade the cloud tier to allow for server-side building and exclude the build/ folder from the repo.
